   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to llfuse's documentation!
==================================

python-llfuse is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API.

python-llfuse was originally part of `S3QL
<http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/>`_, but has recently been factored out
so that it can be used by other projects as well. For that reason, it
does not yet include much standalone documentation apart from the
docstrings.

The :py:obj:`llfuse.main` method is awesome.

The llfuse homepage is at http://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/.
